This is everything done during the February Piscine at Hive, the 42 coding school in Helsinki. The details on how to run each code will be specified in the corresponding folders.

I wanted to keep everything as raw and real as it was during those 4 weeks, with the errors, mistakes, and brainstormed ideas within the PDF files.

This has been one of the most intense experiences I've ever had in my life. The piscine was an energetic frenzy where I met a lot of great, smart, and awesome people, full of knowledge and ideas. Unexpected mistakes and fails happened again and again, which brought a lot of stress, sadness, and happiness. Thank you, Hive, for the opportunity and space you offered, and thank you to everyone that was swimming with me. I'll never forget it.

Kiitos.
